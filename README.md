Online Shop Application
A full-stack Online Shop web application using Spring Boot 2 and Angular 7.
This is a Single Page Appliaction with client-side rendering. It includes backend and frontend two seperate projects on different branches. The frontend client makes API calls to the backend server when it is running.

This project is based on my previous project Online-Shopping-Store, which uses FreeMarker as template engine for server-side rendering.

Live Demo: https://springboot-angular-shop.herokuapp.com/
For Heroku application repo cloning, please check Angular7-SpringBoot-hybrid-project.
